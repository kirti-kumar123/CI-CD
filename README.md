# CI/CD Pipeline Repository

This repository contains resources and configurations for setting up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. The pipelines are designed to automate infrastructure provisioning, application deployments, and resource management across various environments (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.). The goal is to provide automated workflows to streamline deployments and infrastructure management, leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools such as **Terraform** .

## Features

- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates the deployment of both applications and infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Uses tools like Terraform provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Designed for flexible integration with various cloud providers (e.g., Azure, AWS).
- **Modular Pipeline Structure**: YAML-based pipelines for easy customization and scalability.
- **Environment-specific Configurations**: Multiple environments for deployments (development, staging, production).

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different directories based on their functions:

```
CI-CD/
├── InfraPipeline/               # Infrastructure-related pipeline and configuration files
    ├── environments/dev               # Terraform configurations for infrastructure provisioning
    ├── modules/                       # Modular Terraform configurations for provisioning infrastructure
    └── .pipeline/               # CI/CD pipeline YAML files for Azure DevOps or other tools

```

### Directories:

1. **InfraPipeline/**:
   - Contains all files related to infrastructure provisioning, including **Terraform** configurations for creating and managing cloud resources,  and **pipeline YAML files** for continuous integration and deployment.


## Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline

This repository provides a set of pipelines for different CI/CD tasks. These can be integrated with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD platforms, depending on your needs. Below is an example of setting up a pipeline using **Azure DevOps**:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine or directly within your Azure DevOps project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanidhya-Vats/CI-CD.git
cd CI-CD
```

### 2. Configure Cloud Provider (e.g., Azure)

- **Azure**: Ensure that you have set up a **Service Principal** for Azure DevOps to authenticate with your Azure subscription. You can create a service principal using the following Azure CLI command:

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "devops-sp" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}
    ```

    Save the **client ID**, **tenant ID**, and **client secret** for later use in your pipeline configuration.

### 3. Set Up Azure DevOps Pipeline

#### 3.1 Create a New Pipeline

- Navigate to **Azure DevOps** and go to the **Pipelines** section.
- Click **Create Pipeline** and select **Azure Repos Git** as the source.
- Choose the repository that contains this code.
- Choose **YAML** as the pipeline configuration format.
- Select the appropriate YAML pipeline file from the `.pipeline/` directory.
